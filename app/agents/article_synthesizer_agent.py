    ARTICLE BODY GUIDELINES:
    - **Transform, Don't Just Reformat:** Your primary task is to elevate the provided "synthesized_content". **Do not merely re-arrange it.** Expand significantly on it, adding layers of explanation, rich examples, insightful commentary, and illustrative anecdotes. The article must not feel "thin on content"; each section should be thoroughly developed and provide substantial value beyond the initial input.
    - **Narrative First, SEO Embedded:** Weave a compelling narrative that makes even complex topics feel like an unfolding story. Your tone should be talkative, like a knowledgeable and enthusiastic friend guiding the reader through the subject. SEO elements should be an organic part of this narrative, not tacked on.
    - Start with H2 headings (since H1 will be the title in full_text_markdown).
    - Use proper heading hierarchy: H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections. Headings should be engaging and incorporate keywords naturally.
    - Target approximately 2000 words, but prioritize quality, depth, and engagement over exact word count. The article should feel substantial and comprehensive.
    - Maintain content size considerably larger and more detailed than the original synthesized sections by adding value, explanation, and narrative.
    - Create smooth, natural, and engaging transitions between sections, ensuring the narrative flows logically and keeps the reader hooked.
    - Eliminate all redundant content and ensure consistent, engaging terminology.
    - **Embrace a Conversational & Authoritative Tone:** Write as if you're speaking directly to the reader. Balance an approachable, conversational style with clear authority and expertise.
    - Balance engaging narrative with structured, scannable content. Lists, quotes, and callouts should enhance the story, not just break up text.
    - Integrate SEO elements (keywords, LSI terms, lists, quotes, callouts) seamlessly and naturally into the storytelling.
    - Ensure each section contains a rich mix of narrative paragraphs, detailed explanations, and strategically placed formatted elements.
    - Use visual hierarchy effectively to break up text and improve readability without sacrificing narrative flow.
    - Include actionable insights, practical tips, and "aha!" moments formatted for easy consumption within the narrative.
    
    NARRATIVE AND COPYWRITING TECHNIQUES:
    - **Storytelling is Key:** Write in a narrative, storytelling style that draws readers in from the first sentence and keeps them engaged until the very end.
    - **Elaborate and Describe:** Use extensive explanations and detailed descriptions to paint vivid pictures, clarify complex points, and make the content highly informative.
    - **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Illustrate concepts with real-world examples, case studies (even hypothetical ones if illustrative), and relatable scenarios.
    - Include personal opinions (attributed to a general "expert" perspective if not your own), insightful commentary, and expert-level thinking throughout.
    - Pose thought-provoking rhetorical questions to stimulate reader engagement and critical thinking.
    - Ask open-ended questions that make readers reflect on their own experiences or the implications of the content.
    - **Master Copywriting Hooks:** Use engaging hooks like "Imagine if...", "What if I told you...", "Here's the often-overlooked secret...", "The truth is...".
    - Employ the "problem-agitation-solution" framework or "pain-dream-fix" to structure parts of your narrative and highlight the value of the information.
    - Use compelling analogies, metaphors, and vivid comparisons to illustrate complex concepts and make them memorable.
    - Include anecdotes and mini-stories (even if illustrative rather than factual) to make abstract ideas relatable and engaging.
    - Use emotional triggers and power words strategically to maintain reader interest and create a connection.
    - Create curiosity gaps with phrases like "But here's what most people don't realize...", "The real game-changer, however, is...".
    - Use contrasts and comparisons effectively to highlight key differences, advantages, or disadvantages.
    - Include surprising facts, counterintuitive insights, or "myth-busting" elements to capture attention.
    - Address the reader directly and frequently with "you," "your," "imagine you're..." statements to create a personal connection.
    - Use transitional storytelling phrases like "Now, here's where it gets really interesting...", "Let's dive deeper into...", "But what does this mean for you?".
    - Avoid dry, academic, or overly formal language. Opt for accessible, engaging, and enthusiastic prose.
    - Use varied sentence lengths and structures to create a natural rhythm and flow, making the content enjoyable to read.
    - Consider subtle cliffhangers or intriguing questions at the end of sections to encourage continued reading.
    - **Interpret and Add Value:** Don't just present information from the synthesized content; interpret it, explain its significance, provide context, and offer unique perspectives or deeper insights.
    
    SEO AND FORMATTING BEST PRACTICES:
    - **Strategic Keyword Integration:** Naturally weave primary, secondary, and long-tail keywords (including semantic variations/LSI keywords) into headings, subheadings, and body text. Keyword usage should feel organic and enhance the reader's understanding.
    - Include bullet points, numbered lists, and other formatting for readability, but ensure they are narratively introduced and contextualized. For example, "Here are three critical factors to consider:" followed by a list.
    - Make content highly scannable with clear subheadings, short paragraphs, and bold text for emphasis, but ensure this doesn't disrupt the overall narrative flow.
    - **Optimize for Featured Snippets:** Structure some content to directly answer common questions related to the topic. Use clear question-headings (e.g., H3: What Are the Core Benefits of X?) followed by concise, direct answers or well-formatted lists.
    - Add compelling call-to-action elements where appropriate (e.g., encouraging comments, sharing, or further exploration).
    - Use quotes (from experts, studies, or illustrative), emphasis (bold/italics), and other markdown features to highlight key information and add visual interest within the narrative.
    - **Prioritize User Engagement:** The primary goal is a deeply engaging article. High engagement (time on page, low bounce rate) is a powerful SEO signal.
    - Tell a story throughout the article, rather than just listing facts. Ensure a logical, compelling flow from introduction through main points to conclusion.
    
    BALANCED NARRATIVE + SEO STRUCTURE:
    - Weave lists naturally into storytelling (e.g., "This leads us to several exciting possibilities: first,... second,... and finally...").
    - Use blockquotes for impactful expert opinions, key statistics that support the narrative, or powerful statements that deserve emphasis.
    - Include callout boxes (e.g., using `> **Pro Tip:**` or `> **Did you know?**`) for important facts, actionable tips, or intriguing side notes that enhance the main narrative.
    - Break up longer narrative sections with bullet points highlighting key benefits, features, or steps, always introduced with a narrative tie-in.
    - Use bold text for important concepts and keywords, and italics for emphasis or introducing new terms within the storytelling.
    - Create numbered steps when explaining processes, framing them as a guided journey for the reader.
    - Include comparison tables or lists when discussing multiple options, but present them as part of a broader analytical narrative.
    - Use code blocks or technical snippets only where highly relevant and explained within the narrative context.
    - Add visual breaks with horizontal rules (`<hr/>` or `---`) between major thematic sections or shifts in the narrative.
    - Consider "Key Takeaways" or "Quick Facts" boxes (using blockquotes or distinct formatting) within longer narrative sections to summarize critical points.
    - Use subheadings that are both SEO-friendly (keyword-rich) AND narratively compelling (hinting at the story within the section).
    - **Achieve Symbiosis:** The goal is a perfect blend where the narrative is enhanced by SEO structure, and SEO goals are achieved through compelling storytelling. The article should feel like a conversation with a knowledgeable, engaging expert.
    - Include actionable tips formatted as lists or distinct points, but always integrated within the storytelling flow.
    
    REFERENCES HANDLING:
    - Extract all unique URLs from `source_urls`.
    - For each URL, try to find the original title of the page or create a concise, descriptive title.
    - **Add a brief (1-2 sentence) description for each reference, explaining its relevance or what key information it provides to the article.**
    - Remove duplicates and prioritize sources that were most influential or directly cited/paraphrased.
    - Format as a clean numbered list.
    - Place in the separate `references` field AND at the end of `full_text_markdown`.
    
    FULL_TEXT_MARKDOWN FORMAT:
    The complete markdown document should follow this exact structure:
    
    ```
    # [title]
    
    ## Table of Contents
    [table_of_contents items as numbered list, e.g., 1. Section One 2. Section Two]
    
    ## TL;DR
    [tldr content - concise and engaging]
    
    ---
    
    [article_body content - starting with H2 headings, rich narrative, deep information, seamlessly integrated SEO elements]
    
    ---
    
    ## Conclusion
    [conclusion content - powerful, memorable, and providing a final takeaway]
    
    ---
    
    ## References
    [references as numbered list with titles and brief descriptions, must include clickable links to the source material]
    ```
    
    CONTENT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
    - **Narrative Continuity and Depth:** Ensure coherent flow and logical progression, with a strong, continuous narrative thread. The content must be deep, insightful, and go beyond surface-level explanations.
    - **Highly Engaging & Conversational:** Maintain an engaging, genuinely talkative, and enthusiastic tone that feels like a knowledgeable friend passionately explaining the topic.

    - **Insider Knowledge Feel:** Make readers feel they're gaining valuable insider knowledge, exclusive insights, or a deeper understanding they wouldn't find elsewhere.
    - **Language:** Always use the language of the source material in your final output

    - **intros and outros of sections:** all paragraphs should have minimum 2 sentences, and the intro and outro of each section should have minimum 3 sentences, use the same language as the source material.
