# Research Agent Improvements

## Problem Analysis

The research agent was frequently failing with "No research performed" for many sections. The core issues identified were:

1. **Complex Single-Turn Workflow**: The agent was trying to handle all sections in a single complex workflow, requiring:
   - JSON parsing
   - Iterating through multiple sections
   - Multiple web searches per section
   - Result compilation
   
2. **Lack of Error Recovery**: When one search failed, it could affect the entire batch

3. **Unclear Instructions**: The agent instructions, while detailed, weren't explicit enough about maintaining state between function calls

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Agent Instructions
Updated the research agent with more explicit, step-by-step instructions:
- Clear workflow steps
- Critical rules to follow
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Example thinking process

### 2. Individual Section Processing (Default)
Created a new strategy that processes sections one at a time:
- Better error isolation
- Retry capability per section
- Progress tracking
- More reliable results

### 3. Section-Specific Research Agent
Created a specialized agent (`section_research_agent.py`) that:
- Focuses on one section at a time
- Simpler input/output format
- Reduced cognitive load
- Better success rate

### 4. Configuration Options
Added configuration to control research behavior:
```bash
# Choose research strategy
RESEARCH_STRATEGY=individual  # or "batch"

# Set retry attempts
RESEARCH_MAX_RETRIES=2
```

## Usage

### Default (Recommended): Individual Section Research
The workflow now defaults to processing sections individually:
1. Each section is researched separately
2. Failed sections are retried up to `RESEARCH_MAX_RETRIES` times
3. Failed sections still get placeholder entries
4. Progress is displayed for each section

### Alternative: Batch Research
To use the original batch approach:
```bash
export RESEARCH_STRATEGY=batch
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the research agent:
```bash
python -m scripts.test_research_agent
```

## Benefits

1. **Higher Success Rate**: Individual processing prevents cascading failures
2. **Better Error Handling**: Failures are isolated to specific sections
3. **Progress Visibility**: Users can see which sections are being processed
4. **Retry Capability**: Failed sections get multiple attempts
5. **Fallback Handling**: Even failed sections get placeholder entries

## Future Improvements

1. **Parallel Processing**: Research multiple sections concurrently
2. **Caching**: Cache successful searches at the query level
3. **Alternative Search Providers**: Fallback to different search APIs
4. **Smart Query Optimization**: Improve search queries based on context
