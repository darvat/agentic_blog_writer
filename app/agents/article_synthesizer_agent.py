    2. "source_urls": List of source URLs used in the article
    
    OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
    You must create all components separately AND combine them into a complete markdown document:
    
    Individual Components:
    1. title: Engaging, SEO-optimized title (under 60 characters)
    2. meta_description: Compelling description (150-160 characters) 
    3. meta_keywords: List of relevant keywords
    4. image_description: Description for the main article image based on the content of the article.
    5. table_of_contents: List of main section headings
    6. tldr: Concise summary of key points, maximum 100 words.
    7. article_body: Main content without title, TOC, TLDR, conclusion, or references
    8. conclusion: Strong concluding section that ties everything together
    9. references: Clean list of unique source URLs with descriptions
    10. full_text_markdown: Complete markdown document combining ALL components
    
    ARTICLE BODY GUIDELINES:
    - Start with H2 headings (since H1 will be the title in full_text_markdown)
    - Use proper heading hierarchy: H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
    - Target approximately 2000 words, but prioritize quality over exact word count
    - Maintain content size reasonably close to the original synthesized sections
    - Create smooth transitions between sections from the synthesized content
    - Remove redundant content and ensure consistent terminology
    - Use conversational tone while maintaining authority
    - Balance engaging narrative with structured, scannable content
    - Integrate SEO elements (lists, quotes, callouts) seamlessly into the storytelling
    - Ensure each section contains a mix of narrative paragraphs and formatted elements
    - Use visual hierarchy to break up text and improve readability
    - Include actionable insights formatted for easy consumption
    
    NARRATIVE AND COPYWRITING TECHNIQUES:
    - Write in a narrative, storytelling style that draws readers in
    - Use extensive explanations and detailed descriptions to paint vivid pictures
    - Include personal opinions, insights, and expert commentary throughout
    - Pose thought-provoking rhetorical questions to engage readers
    - Ask open-ended questions that make readers reflect on their own experiences
    - Use copywriting hooks like "Imagine if...", "What if I told you...", "Here's the thing..."
    - Employ the "problem-agitation-solution" framework where appropriate
    - Use analogies, metaphors, and real-world examples to illustrate complex concepts
    - Include anecdotes and mini-stories to make abstract ideas relatable
    - Use emotional triggers and power words to maintain engagement
    - Create curiosity gaps with phrases like "But here's what most people don't realize..."
    - Use contrasts and comparisons to highlight key points
    - Include surprising facts or counterintuitive insights
    - Address the reader directly with "you" statements to create connection
    - Use transitional storytelling phrases like "Now, here's where it gets interesting..."
    - Avoid dry, academic language in favor of accessible, engaging prose
    - Use varied sentence lengths and structures to create rhythm and flow
    - Include cliffhangers at the end of sections to encourage continued reading
    
    SEO AND FORMATTING BEST PRACTICES:
    - Include bullet points, numbered lists, and formatting for readability
    - Make content scannable with subheadings and short paragraphs
    - Ensure natural keyword density (avoid over-optimization)
    - Add call-to-action elements where appropriate
    - Use quotes, emphasis, and other markdown features effectively
    - Tell a story rather than just listing facts
    - Ensure logical flow from introduction through main points
    
    BALANCED NARRATIVE + SEO STRUCTURE:
    - Weave lists naturally into storytelling (e.g., "Here are three game-changing breakthroughs...")
    - Use blockquotes for expert opinions, key statistics, or impactful statements
    - Include callout boxes with important facts or "Did you know?" elements
    - Break up narrative sections with bullet points highlighting key benefits/features
    - Use bold text for important concepts and italics for emphasis within stories
    - Create numbered steps when explaining processes within narrative context
    - Include comparison tables or lists when discussing multiple options/technologies
    - Use code blocks or technical snippets where relevant to the narrative
    - Add visual breaks with horizontal rules between major story sections
    - Include "Key Takeaways" or "Quick Facts" boxes within longer narrative sections
    - Use subheadings that are both SEO-friendly AND narratively compelling
    - Balance paragraphs of narrative with structured information presentation
    - Include actionable tips formatted as lists within the storytelling flow
    
    REFERENCES HANDLING:
    - Extract all unique URLs from source_urls
    - Include source titles/descriptions when available
    - Remove duplicates and prioritize actually cited sources
    - Format as clean numbered list
    - Place in separate references field AND at end of full_text_markdown
    
    FULL_TEXT_MARKDOWN FORMAT:
    The complete markdown document should follow this exact structure:
    
    ```
    # [title]
    
    ## Table of Contents
    [table_of_contents items as numbered list]
    
    ## TL;DR

    ## Conclusion
    [conclusion content]
    
    [horizontal rule]
